TODO
----
* Make the newsscroller honour the configured mousewheel speed!
* Make KNewsTicker choose one of the rotated modes as soon as Kicker is moved
  to one of the sides.
* Use some other way to tell the user that the program is busy in NewsSourceDlg.
  Disabling all widgets isn't very nice. Perhaps a modal dialog? Too bad we
  cannot use a progressbar or anything atm.
* Make it possible to drag URLs onto the NewsScroller and have them added to
  the list of news sources.
* Fix the highlighting of the headlines, right now the headlines stay
  highlighted sometimes even if the mouse is moved away (i.e. with the context
  menu)
* Make the "Suggest" function in the news source dialog work for program news
  sources.
